# Web UI

React + Vite app in the `web/` git submodule (source of truth: [legibet/mycode-web](https://github.com/legibet/mycode-web)). Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning. Built assets are copied to `internal/server/webdist/` for Go embedding.

## Serving Modes

- `mycode-go web` — serves packaged web assets from the embedded `webdist` filesystem, or from `MYCODE_WEB_DIST` / local `web/dist` during development.
- `mycode-go web --dev` — API only; no static files (pair with `pnpm --dir web dev`).

CORS is disabled by default for the packaged web app. The API-only dev handler allows only `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173` for the Vite dev server.

## Message State Model

`useChat.ts` keeps two pieces of reducer state:

- `rawMessages: ChatMessage[]` — canonical block messages (mirrors the JSONL timeline; includes `role: "compact"` markers)
- `toolRuntimeById` — ephemeral tool runtime state (streaming output, pending flags, final result)

The render-ready list `messages: RenderMessage[]` (where `RenderMessage = ChatMessage | CompactMarkerMessage`) is derived via `useMemo(buildRenderMessages(rawMessages, toolRuntimeById))`. There is no second copy of state to keep in sync — every reducer transition produces a new `rawMessages` and/or `toolRuntimeById` reference and the projection is recomputed.

`CompactMarkerMessage` (`{kind: "compact-marker", sourceIndex, renderKey}`) carries no content of its own — it just tells `MessageList` to render `CompactMarker` instead of `MessageBubble`. Use the `isCompactMarker(msg)` type guard from `types.ts` to narrow when iterating.

State is managed via `useReducer` with actions:

- `set_messages` — load session history from server
- `start_turn` — optimistic user message + empty assistant
- `rewind_and_start_turn` — rewind + optimistic new turn
- `apply_event` — apply one SSE event to `rawMessages` / `toolRuntimeById`
- `rollback` — restore the snapshot taken before an optimistic turn

`buildRenderMessages()` in `utils/messages.ts` is the single projection used by both initial load and live streaming: tool results visually attach to their `tool_use`, multiple assistant turns of a tool loop merge into one bubble, and every `role: "compact"` entry surfaces as a `CompactMarkerMessage`. A live `compact` SSE event appends a `{role: "compact"}` entry to `rawMessages`; the marker appears on the next render.

Key design decisions:

- Tool results persisted as `user` messages with `tool_result` blocks are visually folded into the preceding assistant message during rendering
- Each render message and block gets a stable `renderKey` for React reconciliation
- `sourceIndex` tracks the original message position; rewind uses this index against the visible list, so rewinding to a real user message before a `compact` marker slices the marker away too

Rendering rules:

- `thinking` blocks → `ReasoningBlock` (expanded while streaming, uses `meta.duration_ms` when present)
- `tool_use` blocks → `ToolCard` (with matching `tool_result` and live runtime folded in)
- `text` blocks → `MarkdownBlock`
- `image` blocks → inline image preview in `MessageBubble`
- `compact-marker` entries → `CompactMarker` (a thin labelled divider, no interactivity)

`MessageList` renders long histories as a tail window: initial session load renders the latest messages and scrolls to the bottom before paint. Scrolling near the top prepends older messages in batches and preserves the current viewport by restoring the previous distance from the bottom. Auto-scroll follows incoming message updates only while the user is already near the bottom; local height changes such as expanding tools do not trigger it.

## Streaming

1. `POST /api/chat` → get `{run, session}`
2. `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/stream` → SSE reader
3. Each `data:` line parsed as `StreamEvent`, dispatched to reducer
4. `data: [DONE]` ends the stream
5. On disconnect: attempt session reload recovery via `GET /api/sessions/{id}`
6. 409 conflict: attach to the existing run's stream

A live `compact` SSE event is consumed by the reducer at the position it arrives — the marker lands between whatever just streamed and whatever streams next, mirroring where the agent emitted it (e.g. between two tool calls of the same turn). The server has already persisted the `compact` JSONL record at the same point, so a later session reload renders the same marker without any extra round-trip.

`permission_request` opens the approval prompt. `permission_resolved` clears it. `deny` cancels the active run.

Streaming state tracking:

- `streamTokenRef` — incremented to invalidate stale streams
- `pendingRequestTokenRef` — deduplicates concurrent send requests
- `activeRunRef` — tracks the current run for cancel

Attachments:

- `InputArea` always shows the attachment button and supports file picker and drag-and-drop
- UTF-8 text/code/config files are attached as the same text snapshot format used by CLI `@file`
- Images and PDFs are sent as structured `input` blocks
- The attachment button uses `image_input_models` and `pdf_input_models`; unsupported pending attachments are cleared on model switch

## Config Persistence

Web UI config is persisted to `localStorage`:

- `provider`, `model`, `cwd`, `reasoningEffort`
- `auto` and empty string both mean "do not send reasoning_effort to server"
- The reasoning effort selector in the sidebar only renders when `supports_reasoning_effort` is true AND the current model appears in `reasoning_models` (from `GET /api/config`)
- Settings editor options come from `provider_type_env_vars` and `provider_type_default_models`

## Build

```bash
pnpm --dir web check
pnpm --dir web typecheck
pnpm --dir web test:run
pnpm --dir web dev
pnpm --dir web build
./scripts/sync_web_dist.sh
```

`./scripts/sync_web_dist.sh` copies `web/dist/` into `internal/server/webdist/`. The Go build tag `embedweb` embeds that directory for release builds. Without embedded assets, the server can still serve an explicit `MYCODE_WEB_DIST` or local `web/dist` directory.
